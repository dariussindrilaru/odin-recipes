        <h1>How to Boil Corn on the Cob</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Learn how to boil corn on the cob! Sweet, juicy, and golden, it's the BEST summer side dish. Top it with
          butter,
          salt, and pepper, and dig in!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>4 to 8 ears fresh sweet corn, husks and silks removed</li>
          <li>Butter or compound butter, for serving</li>
          <li>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add the corn. Cook, stirring occasionally to make sure the corn
            is
            submerged, for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the corn is tender and bright yellow. Alternatively, place the corn
            in
            a
            large pot filled with cold water. Bring it to a boil and cook 1 to 2 minutes, until the corn is just tender.
          </li>
          <li>Drain and serve warm with butter, salt, and pepper.</li>
